// they require had never been deployed to production. Green component tests
// could not detect that mismatch.
//
// After a database feature and its release-ready data are deployed and verified,
// change its value here in the same release. `npm run
// verify:production-capabilities` checks this file against meaningful anonymous
// production results before GitHub/Vercel deployment.

  // mode was never opened, so production `forum_mode()` returns "off" and every
  // click on the nav item landed on "Discussions are temporarily unavailable".
  // The link was also in the footer and in the sitemap, so Google was being
  // asked to index a dead end. Verified against production the same day:
  // forum_mode -> "off", get_forum_topics -> [], get_forum_feed -> [],
  // and one profile in the whole database.
  //
  // This flag is the honest state until the mode is actually opened. Nothing is
  // deleted -- the ~40 forum files and their tests stay, and the routes still
  // resolve to ForumFeatureUnavailable so a shared link explains itself instead
  // of 404ing.
  //
  // Before flipping this back to true: publish forum rules in the Terms (they
  // currently say nothing about discussion, conduct, harassment or abuse, while
  // the schema defines report reasons for abuse_or_bullying, sexual_content and
  // self_harm), wire forum_admin_set_suspension to a UI (no component calls it
  // today), and open the database mode. Users are 14-18.

  // both flip together. contentReporting is a separate decision and stays
  // off for now — NOT because a moderation path is missing (AdminPanel's
  // "Reports" tab / useReports.js is a complete is_admin-gated queue, and

  // any signed-in account can already insert a report via the console
  // regardless of this flag (VideoReport.jsx's reportUiEnabled() only hides
  // the UI control, DB RLS is the real boundary) — the flag just decides
  // when students are actually shown the "Report an issue" button.
